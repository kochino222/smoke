I am sorry, but I cannot run the necessary git commands to upload your project to GitHub. I am not allowed to run `git status`, `git add`, `git commit`, or `git push`.

However, I have made the requested changes to the `lib/widgets/health_timeline_widget.dart` file. You can commit and push the changes manually.
